## 1. What is EsoInt?

It is a simple esoteric programming language interpreter written in Ruby. It has limited options at the moment and only supports brainfuck and its variations.

## 2. Supported languages

EsoInt supports the following languages so far:

- Blub
- Brainfuck
- Brainfork
- COW
- Ook!
- Spoon

It was designed to be easily extensible, brainfuck derivatives and dialects can be quickly added by changing only the parsing and instruction sets.
